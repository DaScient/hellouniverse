We utilize data from various market sources, apply technical analysis to detect potential Short Squeeze signals, and then display the results in a user-friendly format. The below script should calculate potential returns and estimate when the short squeeze is expected to begin based on certain market signals.\n\nHere's an outline of what the script does for us:\n\n- Analyze data to detect short squeeze opportunities. \n- A short squeeze typically happens when the price of a stock rises sharply, forcing traders who have bet against the stock (short sellers) to buy shares to cover their positions, further driving the price up. This can be detected by analyzing indicators like:\n-- Short Interest Ratio: Percentage of shares that are shorted relative to the float.\n-- Price Action: Price rising rapidly after consolidation or downward trend.\n-- Volume: Unusually high volume relative to previous periods.\n-- Displays results: List out potential short squeeze candidates, their expected return, and an estimated time when the squeeze could occur based on historical patterns.","metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#!/usr/bin/env python\n# Enhanced Real-Time Trading Signal Script for 10,000+ Tickers\n# ---------------------------------------------------------------\n# This script downloads 1-minute intraday stock data for a large universe of tickers,\n# calculates an expanded set of technical indicators, and evaluates a composite scoring system.\n# With adjustable thresholds and dynamic risk management (ATR-based), it is designed for real-time use.\n#\n# Key Improvements:\n#   - Adjustable composite thresholds for increased sensitivity (default: 3/7).\n#   - Batching and high-parallelism processing to handle up to 10,000 tickers.\n#   - Scheduled real-time runs (every minute during market hours).\n#   - Enhanced logging and error handling for reliability.\n#\n# DISCLAIMER: This script is for educational purposes only and does not constitute financial advice.\n# Always perform your own due diligence and risk management before trading.\n\n!pip install yfinance pandas tqdm schedule config --quiet\n\nimport yfinance as yf\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport datetime\nimport concurrent.futures\nimport time\nimport schedule\nfrom tqdm import tqdm\n\n# Global verbosity flag.\nverbose = True\n\n# Adjustable thresholds for composite scoring (lower = more sensitive)\nCOMPOSITE_LONG_THRESHOLD = 3  # out of 7\nCOMPOSITE_SHORT_THRESHOLD = 3  # out of 7\n\n# Attempt GPU acceleration using cuDF if available.\ntry:\n    import cudf\n    gpu_enabled = True\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"GPU acceleration enabled using cuDF.\")\nexcept ImportError:\n    gpu_enabled = False\n    if verbose:\n        print(\"cuDF not available;
